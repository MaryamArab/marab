        <h5>Thinking about one's thinking</h5>
        <p>Metacognition is, put simply, thinking about one’s thinking.  More precisely, it refers to the processes used to plan, monitor, and assess one’s understanding and performance. </p>
        <p>
            Metacognitive practices increase students’ abilities to transfer or adapt their learning to new contexts and tasks.
            They do this by gaining a level of awareness above the subject matter: they also think about the tasks and contexts of
            different learning situations and themselves as learners in these different contexts. </p>
        <p>
            When Pintrich (2002) asserts that “Students who know about the different kinds of strategies for learning, thinking, and problem solving will
            be more likely to use them” (p. 222), notice the students must “know about” these strategies, not just practice them.
        </p>
        <p>Metacognitive practices help students become aware of their strengths and weaknesses as learners, writers, readers, test-takers, group members, etc.  A key element is recognizing the limit of one’s knowledge or ability and then figuring out how to expand that knowledge or extend the ability.</p>

        <h5>self-regulation</h5>
        <p>Self requlation is evaluating ourselves, identify our strengths and limitations and then effectively employ the appropriate strategies.It involves being self-motivated and engaged.</p>
        <p>In contrast, metacognition is more specific. Jennifer Livingston of the University at Buffalo offers a clear definition and states that metacognition ‘refers to higher order thinking which involves active control over the cognitive processes engaged in learning’.</p>
